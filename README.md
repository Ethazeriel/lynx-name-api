# lynx-name-api

Very simple server and script file to fetch dynamic names and rename computers for use in Hybrid-AzureAD Joined environments.

The node server is intended to be run on a domain-joined local machine and will track computer serial numbers, so if a machine is reimaged it will receive the same name.
